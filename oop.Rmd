# Use Case

Results object for your package

- data.frame
- author
- date_updated

# What do you want people to do with your results object?

- `print()`, `plot()`, `summary()`
  - Most R Packages
- Write computing routines as part of a pipeline
  - BioConductor
- Internal package representation of results
  - `shiny`

# What are objects?

- abstraction/API for data in your code
  - Lets users/coders programatically access data without lots of code
- allow for code reuse and modular code design
- Can be a natural way to map data to a problem

# Why Use Object Oriented Programming?

- You need to go beyond `data.frame`s!
- multiple pieces of information need to go together
  - data.frame: when it was generated, who generated it
- You want your data to be part of a pipeline 
- Have other people developing methods

> Any of these is an opportunity to encapsulate data together into an object!

# Basic OOP Concepts

- Object
    - slots for storing data
- Methods
    - code specific to the object
- Inheritance
    - Can extend previous code

# S3

Use S3 if:

- You are writing a package with a results object
- You want to have `print()`, `summary()`, and `plot()` methods
- Someone isn't going to do something programmatic with your output

# S4

Use S4 if:

- The object is going to be used in more than one package
  - Examples: `matrix`, `ExpressionSet`
- You need type checking for methods
- You need to check the validity of an object
  - make sure that multiple data elements in your object are consistent
  - make sure that metadata is 
  - Other packages may create them

# R6

Use R6 if:

- You want methods to be attached to your object
- You want internal validity
- You are used to Java type objects
- Mutability of objects is important to you

## S4/Bioconductor

Use when data integrity is very important

validity methods

Common Data Types that can work in a pipeline:

- `ExpressionSet` (matrix + metadata)
- 

From [Chambers](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.ss/1408368569):

> The main ideas of object-oriented programming are also quite simple and intuitive:
1. Everything we compute with is an object, and objects should be structured to suit the goals of our computations.
2. For this, the key programming tool is a *class definition* saying that objects belonging to this class share structure defined by properties they all have, with the properties being themselves objects of some specified class.
3. A class can inherit from (contain) a simpler superclass, such that an object of this class is also an object of the superclass.
4. In order to compute with objects, we can define methods that are only used when objects are of certain classes.
